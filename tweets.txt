I went to a restaurant that serves breakfast at anytime, so I ordered french toast during a rock concert
Hear me out okay, a priest and a rabbi walk into a bar
No one can be as awesome as all of us
A little boy goes into the pet store and asks how much the white rabbit is, the guy working there says it's $10,000, but you can take him home for nothing if you make him laugh...so he throws him on the floor and beats the crap out of him
When somebody says "you've been working out!" And you say "yeah?"Then they say "oh, I just mean your face."
Cops really aren't good at their job because they act like they're the only ones who know what illegal things are
